# Frontend

You can refer to the [documentation] (https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started) to learn more.

## Creating a new Vanilla React Project

We can create a Typescript react app using their templates.

We need to call the following command from the root directory.

```sh
npx create-react-app frontend --template typescript
```

The `frontend` directory was automatically created from the above command.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In react we don't need to install dev dependencies separately. All the dependencies can be installed as normal dependencies. The dev dependencies will be automatically striped away when building the project.

## Checking and fixing if there are vulnerabilities

We can check the information about the vulnerabilities by using the following command.

```sh
npm audit
```

We need to fix these vulnerabilities automatically.

```sh
npm audit fix
```

If, the previous one did't work we can force to fix them.

```sh
npm audit fix --force
```
