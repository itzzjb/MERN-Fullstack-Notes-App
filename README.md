# MERN NOTES APP 
- **M**:  MongoDB
- **E**:  Express JS
- **R**:  React JS 
- **N**:  Node Js

**TypeScript**: This is superset of JavaScript that you will be able to declare the type of variables. Similar to Java, Kotlin and Swift.

>[!TIP]
> TypeScript can be used anywhere you use normal JavaScript.

**Bootstrap** : This is a package that you can use with React to get UI responsive components easily.

>[!NOTE]
> When we are using React we are creating a single-page application. We don't reload the whole page but the content that must be change on any event (like navigating to another page) will be changed using JavaScript. We are getting data from the backend in JSON format via HTTP requests. 

**Client-side Rendering** : We don't receive full page from the the server, we only receive the shell. 

**NextJs** : Framework on top of React that enables you to have more control over what data you load on client-side and what pages you load server-side (where the data is already in the page when coming from the server).

>[!NOTE]
> NodeJs allows JavaScript code to run in a server environment. Normally, JavaScript is meant as a language for web browsers. Because of NodeJs we can write our backend using JavaScript too.
